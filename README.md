# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics Project

This project analyzes hospital and patient data using an end-to-end data analytics workflow. The goal is to uncover actionable insights about patient trends, hospital performance, and department efficiency. SQL was used for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI was used for interactive visualizations.

# 📌 Project Goals

- Extract, clean, and transform healthcare data using SQL.
- Perform detailed patient and hospital trend analysis.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key hospital metrics.
- Provide insights to support data-driven decision making for healthcare management.

# 🗂️ Data Source

- A hospital & patient dataset (synthetic / anonymized).
- Includes patient demographics, admissions, departments, and discharge details.

# 🔄 Workflow (ETL → Analysis → Visualization)

1. Extract & Load: Imported dataset into MySQL.
2. Transform: Applied SQL queries for cleaning, filtering, joins, and aggregations.
3. Analyze: Derived insights such as:
  • Patient distribution by department.
  • Monthly admission & discharge trends.
  • Average length of stay.
  • Department performance metrics.
4. Visualize: Built a Power BI dashboard for decision-makers.
